## About
This is 2nd game developed by me, and at the same time second deployed to Google Play Store.

When math class gets boring, your doodles and school supplies come to life! Doodle Trail is a creative Android puzzle game where you draw paths to help a paper ball reach the trash bin. But be careful â€“ the very tools that once helped you in school (scissors, erasers, rulers) are now trying to stop you!

**Note**: This game was overhauled from my previous project "Draw My Trail", featuring a new school-themed concept, updated graphics, and upgraded gameplay mechanics while retaining the original spirit.

## Game Modes

**1. Level Mode**

**2. Endless Mode**
