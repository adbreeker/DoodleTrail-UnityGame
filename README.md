# Draw My Trail

Draw My trail is a simple android game.

The main part of the game is focused on completing subsequent levels by drawing a path for the colored circle to help it reach the finish line while collecting a star.

After completing most of the levels, you can take part in the endless mode, in which you have to constantly draw a path for the colored circle so that it avoids subsequent obstacles and collects stars on its way.
